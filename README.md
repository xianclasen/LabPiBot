# LabPiBot

A simple Python program for controlling an Ada Fruit / stepper motor hat via Twitter mentions.  The bot checks its Twitter account for mentions from the controller account.  If the mention is verified to have come from the controller account, the mention is checked for commands to be executed by the stepper motor.

The sole purpose of this code is to meet my very specific use and comes with no guarantees.
